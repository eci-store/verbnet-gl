<p>This lists all occurrences where the thematic roles expressed in the syntax
of a frame are not the same as those in the semantics. The links lead to pages
at <a href="http://verbs.colorado.edu/vn3.2.4-test-uvi/vn/"
>http://verbs.colorado.edu/vn3.2.4-test-uvi/vn/</a>. Those pages are not always
based on the same XML files as used by these diagnostics. This is for example
the case for the admit verb class. The XML files for these diagnostics have
admit-65.xml for this class, but online we have admit-64.3.php, a slightly
earlier version. As a result, clicking the admit-65 link will give a
page-not-found error.</p>
